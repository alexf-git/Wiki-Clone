Notes	"Motivation: Good job describing the problem being solved. It could be phrased a little more clearly, such as starting it with ""It is difficult to find"" rather than starting the sentence with ""Finding"".

Non-functional requirements: I like these requirments. In the memory optimation section, avoid prescribing specific solutions such as Hash Maps (those are better suited for a design document). Instead, make some goals such as memory usage scales linearly with the number of threads (O(number of threads))."
