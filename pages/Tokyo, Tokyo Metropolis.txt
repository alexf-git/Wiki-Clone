Kotobuki maternity hospital incident
A hospital director, Miyuki Ishikawa, fatally neglected about a hundred babies. There were accomplices, and the Shinjuku ward office was suspected of giving approval for the murders.

In her defense, Miyuki argued that the victims were abandoned infants, and ultimately that their parents should be responsible for their deaths.
Coward!
