Cecil Hotel (Los Angeles)
The first documented suicide at the Cecil occurred on the evening of January 22, 1927, when Percy Ormond Cook, 52, shot himself in the head while inside his hotel room after failing to reconcile with his wife and child. The Los Angeles Times reported that he was rushed to The Receiving Hospital with a slim chance of survival; death records reveal that he died that same evening.[5] The next reported death occurred in 1931 when a guest, W. K. Norton, died in his room after taking poison capsules.[19] Throughout the 1940s and 1950s, more suicides at the Cecil occurred.[5] In 2008, two long-time residents referred to the Cecil as "The Suicide",[20] and it became a popular nickname in social media years later.[19] RoomSpook, a website that tracks hotel deaths, lists at least 13 suicides that happened at the hotel.[21]
